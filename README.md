## HitList Tutorial (code from RayWenderlich.com)

Tutorial from RayWenderlich.com that I'm using to figure out the best way to port CoreData functionality from Objective-C projects to Swift Projects. Not my source code, besides a few experiments to pick at the stack and managed objects for learning purposes, all credit goes to the developers over at RazeWare that designed the tutorial.
